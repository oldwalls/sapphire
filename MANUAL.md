#### 1 · Memory Engine (CSCSR)

### **Chronologically Sorted, Context-Similarity Ranked**

Retrieve the `top_n` memories from the UMB.

Rank them by hybrid score
`0.6 * cosine + 0.4 * lexical_overlap.`

Taper them with an exponential decay of `tau` to floor of `sigma`

## then sort to chronological order

Depth switch `inference_mem`

1 → compare only against prompts

2 → prompts + LLM output

Result = contextual memory echo - the slice we bias the model with.

---
#### 2. Why a plain sliding window isn't enough
Transformers weren't trained just to count tokens.
Billions of sentences imprint higher-order manifolds inside the stack.
To reach them, we need contextual resonance, not a blind 1024-token dump.

---

#### 3 · Why "higher-order manifolds" matter

A deep transformer is not just an n-gram table; successive layers deform input space into **progressively abstract manifolds**.
At the top of the stack the model re-elaborates context: it tries to *complete the latent line of reasoning it has inferred from the prompt*.
If the prompt itself encodes a **coherent induction chain**, those upper manifolds can extend that chain rather than hallucinate noise.

**Key requirement:** feed the network **context tokens that already *relate* across time** - not isolated chunks.

#### 4 · Prompt Constructor Pulse

`config set prompt_constr memory;prompt;memory;tail;prompt;memory;` 

(*a sample CLI command to set this prompt pulse sequence*)

| Segment      | Role                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `memory` (1) | Earliest relevant memory → primes topic baseline |
| `prompt`     | Live user question                               |
| `memory` (2) | Second echo reinforces semantic anchor           |
| `tail`       | Time-ordered last *n* user/LLM turns (n=`top_t`) |
| `prompt`     | Re-inject live question (keeps gradient)         |
| `memory` (3) | Latest high-salience memory closes the loop      |

All memories are **chronological** and exponentially weighted (`tau`, `sigma`).
Each fragment’s tokens receive additive logit bias `weight`.

#### 5 · Logical-Induction Flow (ASCII graph)

```text
           ┌────────────────┐
memory ───>│  Induction L1  │
           ├────────────────┤
           │ context blend  │
prompt ───>│  Induction L2  │
           ├────────────────┤
memory ──> │  Induction L3  │   ← upper-manifold zone
           │(*abstraction*) │
tail   ──> │  Induction L4  │
           ├────────────────┤
prompt ───>│  Induction L5  │
           │(*closure seek*)│
memory ──> │  Induction L6  │
           └────────────────┘
           ┌▼───────────────┐
           │   logits       │
           └────────────────┘
```

*Each arrow injects tokens; memories add soft-bias to matching vocab logits.
*The stack iteratively searches for a sentence that "closes" the abstract pattern crossing all six inductions.

### 6. Soft-Logit Fusion

At each decoding step we take the raw transformer `logits` **add** a context-derived bias vector Δ  
with the operation denotedoted by: ⊕   
The Δ is computed from the CSCSR-ranked memories: every token present in a retrieved memory receives a positive weight proportional to its relevance score. The fused output:

```
logits_fused = logits ⊕ Δ * weight ( weight is obrained using [1. CSCSR] )
```

shifts probability mass toward memory-aligned vocabulary **without hard constraints** - guiding generation while preserving the model’s full dynamic range.

### 7. The Output Sieve
Sample `n_sieve` completions.

Re-rank each candidate vs. UMB.

`sieve_rank_mem`  
1 → *prompt-only*  
2 → *prompt + LLM output*

Return`top-1` ⇒ highest semantic fit.

---

### 8. Project goals: The study of activation techniques for higher manifolds. The Study of NHCE phenomena.  
		Moments where a transformer's negentropy spikes and self-referential behavior emerges.

Prototype timeline
`NHCE_finder.py` → `CSCSR` → `prompt constructor` → Sapphire `v0.13.3`
